## ⚙️ Getting Started


**Clone the repo**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-manager-react.git

**Navigate to project folder**

cd project-manager-react

**Install dependencies**

npm install

**Start the dev server**

npm start

## 💡 How It Works

On Signup, user credentials are stored in localStorage.

On Login, credentials are verified and user session begins.

Projects are tied to the logged-in user using localStorage keys.

Routes like /home, /profile, /project/:id are protected.

Session persists as long as localStorage is not cleared.
